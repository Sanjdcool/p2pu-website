description: "We believe people learn better together. We envision a global network of grassroots learning communities—powered by freely-shared knowledge and people-first organizations—where personal growth and collective transformation is freed from institutional walls. We champion education as a lifelong act of co-construction, with plentiful opportunities for work, study, and play for any willing learner."

        <p>
          Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU) is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization on a mission to cultivate peer learning communities in public spaces around the world. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Born out of the 2008 <a href="https://www.capetowndeclaration.org/read-the-declaration" target="_blank">Cape Town Open Education Declaration</a>a>, P2PU has remained active at the forefront of open education ever since, establishing the first open badging standard with Mozilla, developing the tools that supported some of the first Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), and nurturing experimental online learning communities with a variety of audiences around the globe. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 2015, P2PU has worked with libraries and community-based organizations worldwide to realize our mission and vision through a methodology called learning circles: free, facilitated study groups for people who want to learn something together.

                <h3>Peer learning</h3>
                <p>Underlying our work is the conviction that people develop expertise through their own life experiences, that learning happens whenever people share and connect with others, and that feedback is necessary in order to improve.

                <h3>Community</h3>
                <p>P2PU is a community-centered project, reflected in both what we do and <a href="https://app.gitbook.com/@peer-2-peer-university/s/p2pu-staff-handbook/" target="_blank">how we do it</a>. We believe that sustained learning communities are best created through grassroots collaboration, not hierarchical mandates.</p>

                <h3>Open</h3>
                <p>Our commitment to open is predicated on the belief that we create value not by gatekeeping but by working together, sharing resources, and lowering barriers to entry. P2PU is built on open source technology, and everything we create is free to share, remix, and redistribute. </p>

                <h3>Equity</h3>
                <p>Equity is only possible when we recognize education as a social good rather than a commodity. Furthermore, systemic injustice means that providing access alone is insufficient, and we must actively design for inclusion at every step of the way.</p>
