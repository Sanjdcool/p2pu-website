excerpt: Almost everybody encounters digital technology on a daily basis. Therefore, the desire to improve one’s digital literacy is a means to many different ends, including connecting with family, reading the news, applying for jobs, and expressing oneself creatively. Learning circles are designed to support a group of learners who want to learn the same thing for different reasons, and this makes the group learning format remarkably successful for digital literacy training across both desktop and mobile applications.

### Practices
- Promote learning circles with an end goal in mind, rather than framing it broadly as “digital literacy”. Learners with only basic computer familiarity are often trying to accomplish some of the same fundamental tasks: managing email, backing things up / using cloud storage, word processing, interacting with media such as e-books and music, streaming apps like Netflix, customizing their experience (e.g. changing font size and colors) and familiarizing oneself with the essential features of Zoom and other video conferencing tools. 
- Incorporate online safety and privacy into all learning circles, rather than calling it out as a separate topic. In addition to sharing good practices and showing how to do software updates, many participants will want to establish peace of mind that they are operating virus-free.
- Digital literacy learning circles can be a good pathway into more complex topics, as well as a good fallback option for folks who are interested in a different topic but don’t yet have the computer skills necessary to succeed. In Chicago, the library assessed an individual's computer skills in the first week of learning circles and then recommended separate programs for people who needed a little more support before being able to fully participate in the learning circle that they signed up for.
- Try to avoid making assumptions about learners’ current digital skills or priorities: focus on identifying individuals’ objectives and barriers (e.g. money, anxiety, infrequent access, lack of support) in order to create effective and meaningful programming. Recognizing the ways in which digital literacy interacts with other literacies is an important step in helping participants succeed.
