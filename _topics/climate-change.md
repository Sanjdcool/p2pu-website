excerpt: Climate change education is one of the most popular topics for learning circles, and for good reason: there are few (if any) issues experienced as universally as the effects of humankind on the environment. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed or hopeless when taking on this topic, and that’s ok. The trick is to carve out space where people can improve their understanding and take local action, being proud but recognizing that it’s essential but not sufficient. Learning circles embody the “think globally act locally” mantra, drawing on resources and examples from around the world to generate informed, community-based spaces for both thought and action. So many reasons: talking with kids, making better sense of the news, figuring out how to use time/money, and understanding changing weather patterns we experience.

### Practices
- Climate change can be addressed from a variety of perspectives - science, politics, activism. Find an entry point that seems graspable and creates a shared starting point. All the more important, recognizing that not everyone is starting from the same set of assumptions.
- Use a local initiative as a connection into understanding the environment.  A facilitator named Koi at Kenya National Library Service knew that there was a lot of logging happening in his area. He did a little research to better understand what was happening, and then ran a learning circle on logging and deforestation. At the end of the learning circle, the group decided to start a tree nursery at the library. Recycling, composting, indigienous plant restoration...all sorts of work can serve as basis of praxis. In this case not just learning about, but taking ownership over local spaces.
- Consider shifts in lifestyle to be less harmful: gardening, zero waste, carsharing, ebikes.  Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, reocmmends picking your one thing. LCs can be a format for doing that.
