### About This Topic

We approach **creativity** broadly as the ability to imagine and develop new, useful, or innovative solutions to all kinds of problems. Learning circles are a successful format for convening a group around a specific art or craft (e.g. watercoloring, bookbinding, mending). There are also a number of courses that help foster creative thinking skills, which have relevance across all aspects of life, including business, science, and communications.
