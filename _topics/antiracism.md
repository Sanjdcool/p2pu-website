excerpt: P2PU unequivocally condemns racism, police brutality, and white supremacy in the United States and around the world. A commitment to equity exists at the core of our individual and collective work, and we stand in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and international demonstrations for racial justice. These resources for activism and anti-racism learning circles were compiled by a community of facilitators in June 2020.

### Organizationsâ€™ Strategies for Action:
- Pursuing staff training: de-escalation to limit need to limit state authority presence in facilities, trauma-informed service, exploring how implicit bias has affected regulations/rules and patron use, removing latent racism, classicism (Miami)
- Pushing to bring social workers into the library including having a local field instructor run learning circles (Miami)
- Anti-Racism book discussion group for library staff (Los Angeles)
- Human Libraries 2: patrons can book a 20min conversation with individuals/volunteers who have stories to share and are comfortable speaking/answering questions about their experiences (Ottawa)
- Responding to long wait times and book hold lists by boosting awareness of always-available digital titles (Ottawa) and seeking more licenses for e/audio books (Los Angeles)
- Develop facilitator support for facilitating anti-racist curriculum (Multnomah)
- Think about supporting better community engagement with civic processes (such as navigating community action around setting police budget) (Charlotte)
- Manage transition from looking after self, to colleagues, to community (St. Paul)
- Ensuring the mental health of colleagues; running internal programming to help colleagues feel better prepared/supported (Los Angeles)
- Investigate library names and statues and rename/tear down that which needs to be removed (UK)
- Supporting conversations about current events in learning circles across a variety of topics (Charlotte)

###Questions for prioritizing equity in digital inclusion:
(via the Technology and Innovation Department of the City of Long Beach, CA)

- Burdens and Benefits: Who would benefit or be burdened by this proposal? Would low-income households or communities of color experience a disproportionate burden?
- Understanding Data: What do the various data tell us about who is affected? Specifically, look at race, income, languages spoken, ability, gender, and neighborhood.
- Community Engagement: How do we engage those who are not often represented in decision-making or those most impacted by inequities? Do we engage people early enough in the process to have an impact?
- Decision Making: Who sits at the decision-making table? Who has the power to invite or participate? Whose interests are represented?
- Implementation: How can we advance equity through the goals of a policy or program?
- Unintended Consequences: What unintended consequences might be produced by the program or policy?
- Accountability and Communication: How will we be accountable to, and communicate with, the community throughout implementation?
