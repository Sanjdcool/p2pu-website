## Background

Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU) is a U.S.-based non-profit organization that cultivates peer learning in public spaces around the world through an informal education model that we call learning circles. Our organizations’ role supporting learning circles is multifaceted: we build open source software for managing meetings, we train groups to facilitate learning circles, we maintain an online community for facilitators, and we develop and curate open educational resources. We recently launched two exciting new initiatives: an [institutional membership program](https://www.p2pu.org/en/teams/) for library systems and [credit-bearing learning circles](https://info.p2pu.org/2021/07/21/bringing-college-credits-to-libraries-with-peer-led-learning-circles/) in partnership with College Unbound. 

We are looking to build an ongoing relationship with a contractor to support the UI/UX and front-end development of our open source learning circle tools and resources. To begin, we have scoped out a project between May-July 2022 at a rate between $300-$400/day depending on your level of experience. You can be based anywhere in the world so long as you can regularly meet between 8AM–12PM Eastern US time.

## Responsibilities

* Work with P2PU Community Coordinator to synthesize user feedback and understand user interactions.
* Develop wireframes with input from the P2PU team and external collaborators.
* Work with the P2PU Development Lead to implement frontend UI using React.
* Contribute to current front-end components and libraries for future reuse.
* Optimize components for mobile-first usage and low connectivity environments.
* Identify, track, and address usability issues as they arise.

## Experience and Qualifications:

* 5+ years experience building UI/UX and front-end code for production-grade web/mobile technology utilizing HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, and SASS.
* Experience building using Jamstack (in our case it’s a Jekyll static site using React components to pull data from a Django backend API).
* Comfort making low- and medium-fidelity wireframes using Figma.
* Familiarity with GitHub for version control.
* Strong understanding and background designing user experiences for the web with a focus on efficiency, aesthetics, and accessibility.
* Experience designing user flows and interfaces following existing brand guidelines.
* Experience with the full life cycle of software feature development, from exploration to design to implementation to testing and refinement.
* Intellectual curiosity and passion for challenging the hegemony of formal education through community-based learning. 
* Organized self-starter able to set and meet deadlines, proactively communicate, and create or improve internal processes when needed. 
* Comfort working in a distributed/online setting alongside a small team spread across 9 time zones.
