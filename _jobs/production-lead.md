### Background

Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU) is a U.S.-based non-profit organization that supports community-based alternatives to mainstream formal education. Since 2015, we’ve been running learning circles: in-person study groups for people who want to learn something together. Learning circles currently meet in public libraries and community centers around the world: our partners include public library systems in Chicago, Detroit, Boston, Kansas City, Charlotte, Los Angeles, Toronto, Berlin, Cologne, and Braga (PT) as well as national organizations in Kenya, Poland, Romania, and Finland. 

P2PU’s role supporting learning circles is multi-faceted: we build open source software to support in-person learning communities, we train individuals to facilitate learning circles and maintain a virtual facilitator community of practice, we develop and curate open educational resources, and we help our partners build new pathways for community-based learning in their towns and cities. 

We work closely alongside librarians, designers, researchers, and educators, but operationally we are a distributed 3-person team, based in Boston, Kingston (ON), and Cape Town. You will be the fourth team member. This is a full-time (40 hours/week) position funded for one year with the hope and intent to extend. You can be based anywhere.
